Natural line-height may vary for each font family .
To have some beautiful interfaces with full-pixels height (no decimals), it's important to fix the line height with full pixel.
This fixed line height must be approximately the same line height than the font family.
To compute the natural line height of each font used in EBXÂ®, we put a short text in a span in an empty page with no CSS,
then we apply the font family and a font-size of 100000px.
The line height is measured with the DOM's offset-height of the span, and the ratio can be computed.
We have observed that the ratio is the same for all sizes, so using a font size of 100000 give a more precise natural line height.
We have observed that Chrome prefers a rounded up line-height in full px, and we think that is better to avoid side effects.

Computed natural line-height of fonts:
Arial: 111.718% // supplied with Windows 3.1 (since 1992) and Mac OS X (since 2001) by default

OpenSans: 136.182%
OpenSans-Light: 136.182%

DroidSansMono: 132.715%
Width of a char with DroidSansMono: 60.0098%

Helvetica: 115.000% // not supplied with Windows by default, but it is with Mac
Helvetica Neue: 116.500% // not supplied with Windows by default, but it is with Mac

Trebuchet: 110.742% // not supplied with Mac by default, but it is with Windows
Calibri: 122.070% // not supplied with Mac by default, but it is with Windows

Lato: 100.00% (in 2017, the max font-size in Chrome is 10000px -- 2000 on Firefox, same result)

== Alignment tests with OpenSans, font-size 12px ==
Knowing that the reference value is supposed to be 12px * 1.36182 = 16.34184px
(16 in round version, well, but 17 if we want to keep space to avoid non-full pixel heights of containers)

Chrome works for all line heights, only if the text field have an odd height.
Problem: buttons have an even height (because icons are 16 height).

After a test with Firefox 3.6 on Windows XP VS. Firefox 3.6 on Windows 7,
it is mandatory to enable ClearType on Windows XP for OpenSans to avoid
a too-thin-and-quite-erased effect.
